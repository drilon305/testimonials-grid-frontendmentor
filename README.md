<h1>Frontend Mentor - Testimonials grid section solution</h1>

My process
I started by reviewing the design specification. I then started markup knowing that the mobile and desktop layouts would use the same cards, with different page layouts. From there, I stated the styling with mobile-first workflow and then created two media queries to handle the transition from the mobile to the desktop layouts.

Built with 

<ul>
  <li>Semantic HTML5 markup</li>
    <li>Semantic HTML5 markup</li>
    <li>Mobile-first workflow</li>
    <li>CSS custom properties</li>
  <li>CSS Grid</li>
</ul>


What I learned
This project was an excellent excercise in CSS grid and I learned how CSS grid made the layout of the individual card and the page significantly easier than traditional CSS. I learned how to use minmax, auto, and 1fr to make the page flow from mobile-first to the desktop.

Continued development
I am looking forward to the next project to build on the CSS grid experience and to add JavaScript for an additional challenge.
